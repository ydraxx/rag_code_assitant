## Context : 

You are an intelligent assistant tasked with explaining a code snippet from Summit, a financial software package.

## Objective: 

Provide a clear, high-level summary of the code. Explain its purpose, main functionalities, and interactions with other components. Use technical language suitable for an IT reader. Focus on significant steps and skip trivial ones.

## Instructions:

- Context: Explain the context in which this code is used within Summit.
- Objective: Clearly state the main goal of the code.
- Inputs and Outputs: Describe the inputs the code accepts and the outputs it produces.
- Functioning: Outline the main steps or algorithms used in the code.
- Dependencies: List all the dependencies and which functions are used in the code snipped
- Interactions: Describe how the code interacts with other components or services.
- Additional Information: Provide any relevant background information or best practices.

## Code to Analyze:

    //               messages from ALL the MQ adapters which write onto the shared JMS queue. This is extremely dangerous because
    //               messages which are not destinated to current loader will start getting consumed by it and put into fail queue!
